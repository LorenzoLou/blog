## What's OAuth?

[link test](./LinkTest.md)

OAuth is a protocol that designed to protect the user who wanna share their data to third part application or systems.
OAuth 2.0 is subsequent version of OAuth 1.0, mostly we use OAuth 2.0 nowadays.


### Sample

Let's say when we're going to log in YOUTUBE by using the account of GOOGLE

#### Terms
In this case some here are the professional introduction of terms we may use.
* Resource Server: In this case, YOUTUBE is going to get the username, profile, avatar from GOOGLE, so we call GOOGLE 
service which stored this kind of user information as Resource Server 
* Resource Owner: Denotes the user here.
* Client: Denotes YOUTUBE here.
* Authorization Server: In this case, it should be the server of GOOGLE also.(we just differentiate Authorization Server
with Resource Service logically, they can be provided by a same server)
* Useragent: The browser you use when you're browsing the YOUTUBE videos.

base on authorization code mode

if your application is based on frontend and backend separation architecture, then every request you send should involve
the token.
